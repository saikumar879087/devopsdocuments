-->Introduction
SonarQube (previously called Sonar is an open source software quality management tool.
It will continuously analyze and measures quality of the source code.

I will generate the report if any issues in html format/PDF format.

It is a web based tool supports multiple languages (Java, C#, JS...) It will support multi OS platform (Windows, MAC, Linux...).

It will support multiple databases (MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL.)

Supports multiple browsers (IE, Microsoft Edge, FF, Chrome, Safari)

Sonar qube uses -->It will identifies the below category of issues.

Duplicated code
Coding standards
Unit tests
Complex code

Potential Bugs
Architecture & Design

Maven/Tomcat/-> Developed using Java - supports only Java PL
SonarQube/Nexus/Jenkins -> Developed using this Java -> Supports multiple  Langs..

--> Pre Requisition  for installing sonar qube
Java oracle
Wget Sonar repo 
Sonar qube zip file 
Install sonarqube


-->Architecture
Sonarqube scanner /sonarqube/report generate /errors send to developer


1) Vaulnarabilities
2) Bugs
3) Code Smells

-->Installation 
Install SonarQube Server
admin admin  = username password 

Tomcat/Jboss/Wildfly/Jenkins 8080 I
Nexus/ Jfrog artifactiry --> 8081
SonarQube -> 9000
MySQL DB 3306

In pom.xml update ip address  , token
<sonar.login> tag use for token update

mvn package 
plugin name  is first sonar
mvn sonar: sonar  --> sonarqube scan will perform 
Goal name  is 2nd sonar

HCL App Scan  --> vulnarbilities 

DevSecOps  
Sonar qube token generate by administration in gui of sonarqube console

SONAR QUBE DASHBOARD TABS :

projects -->contain all projects list
issues --> will show all issues in the code developer need to fix those issues
rules --> to generate the report it will check all the rules and should be satisfied
quality profiles: [default / custom]

10 rules / 30 rules like this we use. Devops engineer only create the quality profiles

login soanar console --> create custom quality profile --> create click -->new profile

(name own)-->language (own) -->create click after login quliy profile we see rules --> click on activate more -->activate rules

what ever we want --> make as default now project will use this qulaity profiel only

quality profiles --> collection of rules we are going to apply while execting the sonarqube code 

quality gates --> collection of conditions which we are going to apply while execting the sonarqube code

login sonarqube --> add quality gate-->name own -->add condition-->give metrics and error %-->if that condition failes project will fail Executing
