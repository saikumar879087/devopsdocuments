service can be accessed only with in pod

pods will have unique ip address given by 

network namespace can be found under var/run/netns

CRI plugin creates a network names0pace 

when we not sepcify any namespace its used default namespace

within namespace object name should be unique 

we can use same object name for differnet namespaces

we have to carefully give selectors and labels for the specific pod to access or else we get error 

to enter inside container from pod we use --> kubectl exec -it podname -n namespacename-ns -- sh
in  the above if we have more continers in the pod it will exec by index value 0th index first

if we have more contianers in the pod we use contianer name -->kubectl exec -it podname -c contianername -n namespacename-ns -- sh

we communicate b/w pods within node by using localnetwork or pod ip 

service will act as a loadbalancer and service discovery 
 *cluster port we can access within cluster only 
 *nodeport we can access from outside cluster webpage 30000 to 32767 node port range

if we have 2 pods first pod will be executed if we execute pod
